/**
 * Lists
 * Redis Lists are simply lists of strings, sorted by insertion order. It is possible to add elements to a Redis List
 * pushing new elements on the head (on the left) or on the tail (on the right) of the list.
 *
 * The LPUSH command inserts a new element on the head, while RPUSH inserts a new element on the tail.
 * A new list is created when one of this operations is performed against an empty key.
 * Similarly the key is removed from the key space if a list operation will empty the list.
 * These are very handy semantics since all the list commands will behave exactly like they were
 * called with an empty list if called with a non-existing key as argument.
 *
 * Some example of list operations and resulting lists:
 *
 * LPUSH mylist a   # now the list is "a"
 * LPUSH mylist b   # now the list is "b","a"
 * RPUSH mylist c   # now the list is "b","a","c" (RPUSH was used this time)
 * The max length of a list is 2**32 - 1 elements (4294967295, more than 4 billion of elements per list).
 *
 * The main features of Redis Lists from the point of view of time complexity are the support for constant time
 * insertion and deletion of elements near the head and tail, even with many millions of inserted items.
 * Accessing elements is very fast near the extremes of the list but is slow if you try accessing the middle
 * of a very big list, as it is an O(N) operation.
 *
 * You can do many interesting things with Redis Lists, for instance you can:
 *
 * Model a timeline in a social network, using LPUSH in order to add new elements in the user time line,
 * and using LRANGE in order to retrieve a few of recently inserted items.
 * You can use LPUSH together with LTRIM to create a list that never exceeds a given number of elements,
 * but just remembers the latest N elements.
 * Lists can be used as a message passing primitive, See for instance the well known Resque Ruby library
 * for creating background jobs.
 * You can do a lot more with lists, this data type supports a number of commands,
 * including blocking commands like BLPOP.
 * Please check all the available commands operating on lists for more information,
 * or read the introduction to Redis data types.
